# LogisticRegression_python
Concept of  Logistic Regression, implementation using python sciki-learn, deployment techniques and feature importance.


It uses logistic function which is also known as Sigmoid function.

sig(t) = 1/(1+e^-t), Hypothesis => Z = WX+B

If Z goes for positive infinity, predicted will become 1 and if Z goes for negative infinity, predicted value will become 0.
